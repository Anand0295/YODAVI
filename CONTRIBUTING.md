# Contributing to AI Vision Pro

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AI Vision Pro! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- **Bug Reports**: Use the issue template and provide detailed information
- **Feature Requests**: Describe the feature and its use case
- **Documentation**: Report unclear or missing documentation

### Development Process
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Make** your changes following our coding standards
4. **Test** your changes thoroughly
5. **Commit** with clear, descriptive messages
6. **Push** to your fork (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. **Submit** a Pull Request

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### Local Setup
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-vision-pro.git
cd ai-vision-pro

# Set up development environment
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Start development server
make run
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines
- Use **type hints** where appropriate
- Write **docstrings** for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check linting
make lint

# Run tests with coverage
make test
```

### Example Code Structure
```python
def detect_objects(self, frame: np.ndarray, conf_threshold: float = 0.5) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Detect objects in the given frame.
    
    Args:
        frame: Input image as numpy array
        conf_threshold: Minimum confidence threshold
        
    Returns:
        List of detection dictionaries with class, confidence, and bbox
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Structure
```python
def test_object_detection_accuracy():
    """Test that object detection meets accuracy requirements"""
    detector = PhotoBoothDetector()
    test_image = load_test_image()
    
    detections = detector.detect_objects(test_image)
    
    assert len(detections) > 0
    assert all(d['confidence'] > 0.5 for d in detections)
```

## üìö Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Include examples in documentation

### Documentation Structure
- **README.md**: Main project documentation
- **docs/**: Detailed guides and references
- **Inline comments**: Explain complex logic
- **Type hints**: Document function signatures
